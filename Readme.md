Compile the program like this

```
javac *.java
```

and execute it like this

```
java Main
```
This program is a basic garden simulator. You can create creatures (animals, plants), you can feed animals and water plants. If an animal has reached the availability of 10, you're able to slaughter it and store meat in your fridge. The program is not done and it has several weaknesses.
